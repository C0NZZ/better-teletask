# Better Tele-Task

**Better Tele-Task** (BTT) is a browser extension created by HPI students who love Tele-Task but are sometimes also annoyed by it. If you feel the same, this extension might be right for you.

## What we do

### Subtitles

BTT adds subtitles to Tele-Task videos. These subtitles are generated using publicly available deep-learning-based automatic speech recognition models. This browser extension fetches subtitles for the video you're currently watching.  
Both subtitle generation and storage take place locally on our own server. We do not use your device's resources or any cloud services.

### Player tweaks

BTT also adds some quality-of-life features to the Tele-Task player to make it more convenient to use.
