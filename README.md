# Better Tele-Task
Better Tele-Task is a browser extension created by HPI students who love Tele-Task but are sometimes also annoyed by it. If you feel the same, this extension might be right for you.
## What we do
Better Tele-Task adds subtitles to Tele-Task videos. These subtitles are generated locally using publicly available deep learning-based automatic speech recognition models. Then, we store them on our own servers. This extension only fetches the subtitles for the video you're currently watching.
